# Build settings
# --------------
#
# If you wish to use the gem-version of Minima with or without a Gemfile, use
#   the following setting:
theme: minima
#
# **OR** if you wish to use the theme directly from the GitHub repository by
#   bypassing a Gemfile, use the following setting instead.
#   It is best that you lock to a particular commit and update if uptream changes
#   do not affect your site adversely.
# remote_theme: jekyll/minima@d4d779a
#
# Minima requires the following plugins:
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-seo-tag
#
# Uncomment the following setting if you wish to disable deprecation warnings
#   from newer versions of sass converter. Adapt as required.
# sass:
#   quiet_deps: true
#   silence_deprecations: [import]
